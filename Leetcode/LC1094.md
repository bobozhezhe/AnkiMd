## 1094 Car Pooling

### Question

There is a car with capacity empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer capacity and an array trips where trips[i] = [numPassengersi, fromi, toi] indicates that the ith trip has numPassengersi passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are fromi and toi respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return true if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or false otherwise.

### Example 1

Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false

### Example 2

Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true

### Constraints

1 <= trips.length <= 1000
trips[i].length == 3
1 <= numPassengersi <= 100
0 <= fromi < toi <= 1000
1 <= capacity <= 105

%

### Key Point

1. 建立差分类，实现构造函数 / increment / result
2. 在主类中调用，注意，下车是需要 -1，因为最后一站他不在车上

### Solution 1

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {

        int len = 1001;
        int[] capacities = new int[len];

        Differense df = new Differense(capacities);
        for(int i = 0; i < trips.length; ++i){
            df.increase(trips[i][0], trips[i][1], trips[i][2] - 1);
        }
        
        int[] res = df.result();
        int maxTourist = 0;
        for(int eachTrip : res){
            if(eachTrip > capacity){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private class Differense{
        private int[] diff;

        public Differense(int[] nums){
            assert nums.length > 0;
            diff = new int[nums.length];

            diff[0] = nums[0];
            for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; ++i){
                diff[i] = nums[i] - nums[i-1];
            }
        }

        public void increase(int val, int begin, int end){
            diff[begin] += val;
            if(end + 1 < diff.length){
                diff[end+1] -= val;
            }
        }

        public int[] result(){
            int [] res = new int[diff.length];
            res[0] = diff[0];
            for(int i = 1; i < diff.length; ++i){
                res[i] = res[i-1] + diff[i-1];
            }
            return res;
        }
    }
}
```
